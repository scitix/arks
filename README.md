# Arks

## Overview
*Arks* is an end-to-end framework for managing LLM-based applications within Kubernetes clusters. It provides a robust and extensible infrastructure tailored for deploying, orchestrating, and scaling LLM inference workloads in cloud-native environments.


## Key Features

### Distributed Inference
- *Multi-node scheduling*: Run inference across multiple compute nodes.
- *Heterogeneous computing* support: Works across different hardware types (CPU, GPU, etc.).
- *Multi-engine compatibility*: Supports vLLM, SGLang, and Dynamo.
- *Auto service discovery & load balancing*: Dynamically register and balance application traffic.
- *Automatic weight adjustment*: Adapt to traffic and resource demands in real-time.
- *Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)*: Autoscale applications based on workload.

### Model Management
- *Model caching & optimization*: Efficiently download and cache models to reduce cold-start latency.
- *Model sharing*: Share models across inference nodes to save bandwidth and memory.
- *Accelerated loading*: Leverage local cache and preloaded strategies for fast startup.

### Multi-Tenant Management
- *Fine-grained API Token control*: Issue and manage tokens with scoped permissions.
- *Flexible quota strategies*: Enforce usage limits by total token count or pricing-based policies.
- *Request throttling*: Support rate limiting by TPM (tokens per minute) and RPM (requests per minute) and more rate limiting stategies.

## Architecture

![arks-architecture-v1](docs/images/architecture-v1.png)

*Arks* consists of the following major components:
- Gateway Layer: Acts as the unified entry point for all external traffic. It handles request routing and enforces access policies.
  - ArksToken: Provides fine-grained multi-tenant access control with support for:
    - API token-based authentication
    - Quota enforcement (based on token usage or pricing)
    - Rate limiting (TPM, RPM)
  - ArksEndpoint: Dynamically manages routing rules and traffic distribution across different ArksApplication instances.
    - Supports dynamic weight-based routing
    - Enables automatic application discovery
    - Adjusts traffic flow in real-time based on load or policies
- Workload Layer: Each ArksApplication contains one or more runtime instances. Supported runtimes include vLLM, SGLang, Dynamo.
  Each runtime is deployed as a Kubernetes workload and benefits from:
  - Distributed inference across multiple nodes
  - Support for heterogeneous computing environments
  - Autoscaling via Kubernetes HPA, based on predefined SLOs
- Storage Layer: Using ArksModel to manage model storage. 
  - Supports auto caching of models to reduce cold start time
  - Enables model sharing across applications and nodes
  - Designed for high-throughput model loading and reuse

## Quick Start
### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (v1.20+)
- kubectl configured to access your cluster

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scitix/arks.git
cd arks

# Install envoy gateway, lws dependencies
kubectl create -f dist/dependency.yaml

# Install arks operator
kubectl create -f dist/operator.yaml

# Install arks gateway plugins
kubectl create -f dist/gateway.yaml
```

verification:
``` bash
# Check all component status, should be ready
kubectl get deployment -n arks-operator-system
---
NAME                               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
arks-gateway-plugins               1/1     1            1           22h
arks-operator-controller-manager   1/1     1            1           22h
arks-redis-master                  1/1     1            1           22h

# Check Envoy Gateway status
kubectl get deployment -n   envoy-gateway-system
--- 
NAME                                          READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
envoy-arks-operator-system-arks-eg-abcedefg   1/1     1            1           22h
envoy-gateway                                 1/1     1            1           22h

```

### Examples

Install with: 
```bash
kubectl create -f examples/quickstart/quickstart.yaml
```

Check resources ready:

```bash
# Check all ARKS custom resources
kubectl get arksapplication,arksendpoint,arksmodel,arksquota,arkstoken,httproute -owide
---
# REPLICAS should equals to READY, PHASE should be Running
NAME                                      PHASE     REPLICAS   READY   AGE   MODEL     RUNTIME   DRIVER
arksapplication.arks.ai/app-qwen   Running   1          1       21m   qwen-7b   sglang

NAME                                  AGE   DEFAULT WEIGHT
arksendpoint.arks.ai/qwen-7b   21m   5

# PHASE should be Ready
NAME                               AGE   MODEL                         PHASE

```

### Testing

Get the gateway IP: 

``` bash
# Option 1: Kubernetes cluster with LoadBalancer support
LB_IP=$(kubectl get svc -n envoy-gateway-system --selector=gateway.envoyproxy.io/owning-gateway-name=arks-eg -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
ENDPOINT="${LB_IP}:80"

# Option 2: Dev environment without LoadBalancer support. Use port forwarding way instead
ENVOY_SERVICE=$(kubectl get svc -n envoy-gateway-system --selector=gateway.envoyproxy.io/owning-gateway-name=arks-eg -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl -n envoy-gateway-system port-forward service/${ENVOY_SERVICE} 8888:80 &
ENDPOINT="localhost:8888"

```

Curl the example app through Envoy proxy:

``` bash
curl http://${ENDPOINT}/v1/chat/completions -k \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-test123456" \
  -d '{"model": "qwen-7b", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, who are you?"}]}'
```

Expected response
``` json
{
  "id":"xxxxxxxxx",
  "object":"chat.completion",
  "created": 12332454,
  "model":"qwen-7b",
  "choices":[{
    "index":0,
    "message":{
      "role":"assistant",
      "content":"I'm a large language model created by Alibaba Cloud. I go by the name Qwen.",
      "reasoning_content":null,
      "tool_calls":null
    },
    "logprobs":null,
    "finish_reason":"stop",
    "matched_stop":151645
  }],
  "usage":{
    "prompt_tokens":25,
    "total_tokens":45,
    "completion_tokens":20,
    "prompt_tokens_details":null
  }
}
```
